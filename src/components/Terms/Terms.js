              Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either
              party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other
              party a written Notice of Dispute (<strong>“Notice”</strong>)
              describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the
              requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 16107
              Kensington Drive, #116, Sugar Land, Texas 77479. After the Notice
              is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim
              or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the
              claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
              received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The
              amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be
              disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has
              determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party
              is entitled.

              Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the
              American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), an
              established alternative dispute resolution provider (
              <strong>“ADR Provider”</strong>) that offers arbitration as set
              forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the
              parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The
              rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the
              arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating
              and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are
              in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (
              <strong>“Arbitration Rules”</strong>) governing the arbitration
              are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at
              1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single,
              neutral arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in
              Houston, Texas. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of
              the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
              $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based
              arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims
              or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten
              Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a
              hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any judgment
              on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
              court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own
              costs (including attorney&apos;s fees) and disbursements arising
              out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees
              and costs of the ADR Provider.

              submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
              initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any
              personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
              agreed by the parties.

              arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
              and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any
              other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
              arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive
              of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
              authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary
              remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law,
              the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written
              award and statement of decision describing the essential findings
              and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
              calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
              authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a
              court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and
