            measurement. Third parties (e.g. developers) that you interact with
            as you use the Service may also use these technologies for a variety
            of purposes. We aim to be transparent about how these technologies
            are useful to you, others and us. Because cookies are used to

            Like most similar websites, the website located at www.labs196.com
            (the “Site”) uses cookies. By using the Site and agreeing to this
            policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the
            terms of this policy. All collection and processing of personal
            information is done in accordance with our Privacy Policy.{" "}

          <h3 className={styles.h3}>COOKIES</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            Cookies are small files that are placed on your browser or device by
            the website or app you&apos;re using. Pixel tags (also called clear
            GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage
            or app that allow us to do things like read and place cookies and
            transmit information to us or our partners. The resulting connection
            can include information such as a device&apos;s IP address, the time
            a person viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with the browser
            or device and the type of browser being used.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A
            persistent cookie consists of a text file sent that allows a website
            or app to store and retrieve data on a person&apos;s computer,
            mobile phone or other devices. Some examples include device or HTML5
            local storage and caching. A session cookie, on the other hand, will
            expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is
            closed.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            We may place or use these technologies when you interact with our
            Services, whether or not you are logged in. For example, when you
            visit our website(s) or use our applications, we may place or read
            cookies or receive information from your devices. We may also place
            cookies through a pixel on a partner&apos;s site or through
            developer&apos;s applications.
          </p>
        </Row>
        <Row>
          <h3 className={styles.h3}>WHY WE USE COOKIES</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            We use Cookies for a variety of reasons. We use them to improve our
            Service, to make the ads you see more relevant to you, to count how
            many visitors we receive to a page, to help you sign up for our
            services, to protect your data, or to remember your advertising
            settings.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            While specific names of the cookies and similar technologies that we
            use may change from time to time as we improve and update our
            Service, they fall into the below categories of use:
          </p>
        </Row>
        <Row>
          <h4 className={styles.h4}>Authentication</h4>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            These technologies tell us when you are logged in so we can show you
            your dashboard, cards, transactions and other information about your
            account. They also give us information about your use of the Service
            that we use for a variety of reasons, including making your member
            experience better.{" "}
          </p>
          <h4 className={styles.h4}>Security </h4>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            These technologies help us detect potential or real abuse, Account
            compromises, multiple logins, and other activity. They help us
            determine if the browser you&apos;re using is new and give us
            information about active sessions related to your account. These
            technologies can also help us detect abuse and violations of terms
            and policies that are in place to protect us and our members, for
            example, attempting to determine activity is automated or human -
            initiated

          <h4 className={styles.h4}>Features </h4>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            These technologies can help make your use of the Service smoother
            and easier by remembering the information you provided and allowing
            us to tailor your experience. For example, we may be able to store
            certain preferences or show you relevant information about your
            value exchanges or otherwise learn when you have interacted with
            something on the Service.{" "}
          </p>
          <h4 className={styles.h4}>Advertising </h4>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            These technologies are used to help us display advertisements on
            other platforms or on our own that may be relevant to you.{" "}
          </p>
          <h4 className={styles.h4}>Analytics </h4>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            We may also use the technologies for general research and to
            understand how members are using the Service and / or third - party
            applications.{" "}
          </p>
          <h4 className={styles.h4}>Cookie Consent </h4>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            We use cookies to store your preferences in relation to the use of
            cookies more generally. If you delete this cookie, your preferences
            will not be remembered by the site.{" "}

        <Row>
          <h3 className={styles.h3}>USE OF COOKIES ON MOBILE DEVICES</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            Many mobile devices contain browsers, not unlike browsers for
            computers. When applicable, we will use cookies in the same way we
            do if you are using the Service via your computer. If you consume
            the Service on devices that use local storage, Software Development
            Kits (SDKs) or Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs), we will use
            these technologies to accomplish the same purposes.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            We will use information about your device in ways consistent with
            the above and to improve the Service. We will collect and use the
            information on transactions including payment information any
            applicable account, credit or debit card number and other card
            information, and other account and authentication information
            relating to any transactions.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            As on the web, we also may use these technologies to store an
            identifier or other information on your device. We describe how we
            use these technologies and the information we received through their
            use above.{" "}
          </p>

          <h3 className={styles.h3}>READING COOKIES</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            Web browsers send any cookies for a particular web domain to the
            website each time a device with those cookies accesses content
            served from that domain. This means that any LABS196.com cookie will
            be sent to us when any page is accessed at LABS196.com by that
            device. It also means that these cookies are sent to us when someone
            accesses a third-party website or application that integrates or
            uses our Service.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            We may work with partners so that we can place or read cookies on
            your browsers or devices when you visit third-party services. This
            allows us to do things like read and reference cookies from more
            than one device or browser that you use, on and off of our Service,
            so we can provide you with consistent service across all of your
            devices and improve and understand your experience.
          </p>

        <Row>
          <h3 className={styles.h3}>THIRD PARTY COOKIES</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            We sometimes use third parties in connection with the Service,
            including analytics providers, advertising networks, and developers
            of applications that you can access through our platform. They may
            use a pixel to collect information about your device so that they or
            we can identify you. If you authorize an application on our
            platform, their developers may also use cookies, pixels or similar
            technologies (like local storage or information from your device),
            to help provide you with relevant services. For example, a developer
            or platform partner may use cookies, software developer kits (SDKs)
            or similar technologies to customize your experience while
            you&apos;re using their app. Developers or our partners also may use
            these technologies to help share information with us, like how you
            use their website or application.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            Those developing on our Platform may collect information when you
            view or use them, including information about you and your device or
            browser. They may do this using cookies or similar technologies. We
            require developers to be transparent about what they collect and how
            they use the information. To learn more about the information they
            collect or receive, please review their privacy policies.

          <h3 className={styles.h3}>CONTROL OF COOKIE SETTINGS</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            Your browser or device may offer settings related to these
            technologies, including how to delete or block them. For more
            information about whether these settings are available, what they
            do, and how they work, visit your browser or device&apos;s help
